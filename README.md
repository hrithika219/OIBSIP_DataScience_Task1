# 🛍️ OIBSIP Data Science Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data

## 📌 Objective
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset to extract meaningful insights that can help businesses make informed decisions on customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

---

## 📂 Datasets Used
- `retail_sales_dataset.csv`: Contains transaction data (date, customer, product category, quantity, price, etc.)
- `menu.csv`: Supplementary dataset with nutritional info (for potential product-health analysis)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## 🔄 Process Followed

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Cleaning
- Loaded both datasets using pandas.
- Checked for null values — found none.
- Converted `Date` column to proper datetime format.
- Created new `Age Group` column for customer segmentation.

### 2️⃣ Descriptive Statistics
- Calculated mean, median, mode, standard deviation.
- Summarized sales by product category, gender, and age group.

### 3️⃣ Visualizations
- **Bar Plot**: Total sales by product category.
- **Box Plot**: Spending distribution by gender.
- **Line Plot**: Monthly sales trend.
- **Heatmap**: Correlation between numerical fields.

### 4️⃣ Insights & Recommendations
- **Electronics** had the highest revenue.
- Customers aged **36–50** were top spenders.
- Spending was evenly split between **males and females**.
- Seasonal trends suggest promotional offers could be timed for mid-year peaks.
